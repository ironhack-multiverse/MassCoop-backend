The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before.

The Dwarves, Elves, and Dragons have lived in peace and harmony for many years. But recently, more and more monsters have started to come to this land. The worst thing here is that the commandants and their troops have been captured one by one. There’s nothing we can do at this point other than fight back. \n \nGameplay \n \nAs you play the game, you will get to take the role of the remaining commandants and their armies. The great thing here is that you will be able to control a variety of commandants. You have dragons, for example, which can harness the power of wind, stone, lighting, crystals, and fire depending on their species. \nOn the other hand, you have elves, which have stellar battle skills and agility. Dwarves are really good defenders as well, and they will be able to help you build up your defense. \nAs you start to play the game, you will enter the battlefield, and the idea here is to focus on eliminating your enemies as fast as possible. A good combination of commandants and troops will be what you want to focus on if you want to reach success. \nEach battlefield will have multiple waves. You can either continue to the next wave or stop once you completed a wave. While doing more and more waves is better for you since you get more loot, you also put your commandants in danger. \nOn top of that, Smash Mobs has multiple missions. These are rewarded with medals, and you can also get some gold too. The game will even bring you specific ranks that you can unlock as you progress. \n \nFeatures \n \n•\tSmash Mode where you can battle a multitude of monsters and unlimited stages. \n•\tTraining mode where you can practice before you go on the battlefield. \n•\tMultiple sound effects \n•\tA large variety of commandants for each species. \n•\tIn the near future, Smash Mobs is set to bring in an area expansion, a town system, and a complete reward system! \n \nGraphics \n \nGraphically, Smash Mobslooks great, and it provides you with a constant state of immersion. The experience is a very fun and delightful one, so you are bound to enjoy what the game has to offer. Then there’s the fact that the gameplay is extremely interesting and nothing short of enticing. \n \nFinding the right balance between nurturing your commandants and knowing when to leave the battlefield is a crucial thing here. If you can do that and carefully level up and train your commandants, you will get to reach success extremely fast in the world of Smash Mobs!"

This game places a higher emphasis on individual character attributes compared to its precedent, by not only assigning stats, but by also giving team captains a unique Super Ability and the Mega Strike, an opportunity to score up to six goals. Another introduced mechanic is the power level of the ball: indicated by the color of the glow, the shots of the ball become more quick and powerful the more active it is, thus making it easier to score goals with."

Covert espionage and infiltration?

Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe.

It is the fifth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the second entry the Sonic Riders trilogy. A port for the Xbox 360 was cancelled during development, while a sequel, Sonic Free Riders, was released exclusively for that system in 2010.\n\nGameplay in Zero Gravity is largely similar to its predecessor, with characters racing on different types of hovercraft called \"Extreme Gear\". In addition to the mechanics from the previous game, Zero Gravity adds a new gameplay system based around gravity that replaces the predecessor's \"fuel\" system. During the race, performing tricks and other actions will increase a character's Gravity Points, or GP. If players have accrued enough GP by the time they enter certain areas of the track, they will enter a Zero-Gravity Zone, where they can perform one of two maneuvers. A Gravity Dive will create a small black hole that points gravity forward down the track, giving the player a powerful free-fall boost that is further augmented by striking objects in the vicinity that the hole displaces, such as cars or signs. Alternatively, Gravity Control will alter the gravity of the course, allowing players to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas and shortcuts. Players can also use Gravity Drift to more easily maneuver around sharp corners."

Suppose there are n number of players playing... \n1) All n players would be given a rare question and it very unlikely someone knows the answer. Everyone has to write a fake answer which should look convincing to others when the time comes. \n2) When everyone has submitted their answer in the next screen you will get all the answers submitted by everyone and the right answer(n+1 answers) but nobody know which answer is correct. Everyone has to select the answer they think is the correct answer. \n3) Once everyone has selected the answer in the next screen it shows you who fooled you, how many people you have fooled etc. \n4) You get 2 points for selecting the correct answer and 1 point for fooling each person. And the scoreboard goes on. \n \nThe fun part is all the politics happen when everyone try to promote their answer by conversation. And the best feel you get when you fool everyone around you. \n \nGood Features: \n1) Facebook integration: It is very easy to invite people in the game as it has store all the friends who are playing the game. \n2) Chat: Game has a pretty smooth chat feature if you are playing from different different locations. \n3) Game Notifications: Whenever one of my friend start playing i get a notification with the name who is playing. It gives me the decision ability to play right at the moment since i know who is playing. And the notification takes me directly to the game. \n \nThings i would love to see: \n1) Voice: If somehow it was possible to do conversation using voice instead of chat it would be so great. \n \nGame Link: https://foolio.app.link"

It's pretty much a straight knock off of platformers like Sonic, but it does so with charm, personality, and bags of entertainment. The story revolves around the adventures of a little blue hedgehog (Sonic's sister perhaps?) and finds her travelling through an array of colorful environments, although it's not entirely clear why this should be necessary. In classic platform fashion, she runs around, leaps a bit and dashes at the many enemies which litter her path. In similar style to the Kirby games, you can absorb the power of defeated enemies which comes in handy during later stages, while you can also throw rocks at the bad guys a la Super Mario Bros 2. There are also Sonic-style springboards and the environments you travel through are your standard cutesy platformer-type levels. Adventures of Sting is certainly not shy about where it gets its inspiration from but while this criminal lack of originality has killed many other games in the past, here it seems to work to its advantage and actually results in a curiously enjoyable little title. The game gets off to a great start with its lush visuals which are just bursting with color and personality and with some lovely environments to discover. The controls are easy to pick up, while the platforming itself is largely entertaining and although not overly challenging, maybe this isn't such a big deal. All in all, something of a forgotten gem."

The game is structurally similar to Guitar Hero 5, and supports full band play (lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals) including the drop-in/drop-out and in-song instrument and difficulty change menus, and additional multiplayer modes as Guitar Hero 5. The console versions use instrument-shaped game controllers, while the DS version uses either the \"Guitar Grip\" introduced with the Guitar Hero: On Tour series or a new Drum Skin that comes with the game. Like previous games, virtual avatars of Taylor Swift, Adam Levine, and the band No Doubt are presented in the game.\n\nBand Hero received mixed reviews from journalists. Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the \"Top 40\" pop rock hits, while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers. They also contested the cost of the full game, featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5, and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form. A day after the game's release, the band No Doubt sued Activision, citing similar misuse of their avatars as the Kurt Cobain avatar in Guitar Hero 5."

In the game the player controls a MicroBot; a microscopic robot designed to combat infections in the human body. The robot is tasked with destroying previous generation MicroBots which have become corrupted while fighting disease in the body. \n \nCritics were divided on their opinions of the game, but overall review scores were moderate. Aggregate scores averaged in the 60% range for both platforms at websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Most reviewers praised the game's visual and audio presentation. They felt that the environments were convincing as areas of the body and that the soundtrack was strong. Critics differed in opinion in regards to gameplay; many praised the addition of local cooperative play and the ability to upgrade the MicroBot with new weaponry and features, but many felt the game did not add enough new gameplay elements to the genre to keep the player interested long-term."

Besides the addictive core mechanics of placing towers to stop advancing enemy units, DoA also allows players to take on the role of the attackers seeking to conquer the enemy base.\n\nDoA’s innovative new game concepts include light RTS elements, taking the popular genre to the next level. Players must oversee unit production and upgrades while assembling the most effective army from one of three playable races, each with unique locations, towers, and units. However, without magic, a fantasy game is little more than a toothless lion (or dragon, rather), so a wide range of spells will be available for players to decimate their enemies and protect their forces.\n\nAlthough DoA includes a single-player portion, the focus of the game is undoubtedly multiplayer, where two to four players can take each other on or compete against AI opponents via Internet, LAN, or PSN. The multiplayer component offers three different game modes where players can assume either the defensive or offensive sides – or both!"

Previously visited locations cannot be visited again, and new locations can only be discovered by advancing the story. There are 50 distinct zones of varying size in Brotherhood of Steel.\n\nBrotherhood of Steel uses many of the same mechanics as other entries in the Fallout series, including the SPECIAL (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, Luck) attribute assignment system. These seven attributes are assigned numeric values and govern most interactions in the game. Unlike other Fallout games, however, the values are constant for each character rather than customizable.\n\nSkills exist in this game, but they do not behave like skills in other Fallout games. Rather, they are analogous to perks. When the player levels up, they receive \"skill points\" to increase the power of skills. Some skills also have level restrictions."
